# Image Hotspot Property Editor for Umbraco 7

This is an attempt to provide similar functionality to what was previously available with the [uComponents ImagePoint](http://ucomponents.github.io/data-types/image-point/)
data type in Umbraco, versions 4 and 6.

This one's just called “Image Hotspot” because that's what our clients call it when they ask for this kind of thing :-)

_**PLEASE NOTE:** This may not at all be production ready for your particular use, but if you want to try it out there's
an Umbraco package available on the releases page._



## TODO

- [ ] Get `imageSrc` from a mediapicker value of some sorts (e.g. recursively look for `umbracoFile` as the uComponents data type did)
- [ ] Add configuration prevalue for the `width` used in the backoffice
- [x] Add configuration prevalue for `theme`
- [x] Build script
