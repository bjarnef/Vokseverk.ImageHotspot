# Image Hotspot Property Editor for Umbraco 7

This is an attempt to provide similar functionality to what was previously available with the [uComponents ImagePoint](http://ucomponents.github.io/data-types/image-point/)
data type in Umbraco, versions 4 and 6.

*This one's called “Image Hotspot” because that's what every client calls it :-)*

## TODO

- [ ] Get `imageSrc` from a mediapicker value of some sorts (e.g. recursively look for `umbracoFile` as the uComponents data type did)
- [ ] Add configuration prevalue for `theme`
- [ ] Build script
